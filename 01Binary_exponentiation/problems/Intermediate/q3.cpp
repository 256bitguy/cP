Modular exponentiation is a special case of binary exponentiation. It's used in cryptography to efficiently calculate (base^exponent) % modulus, where all three values are large integers. This is important in cryptographic algorithms like RSA, where modular exponentiation is used to encrypt and decrypt messages securely. 
It ensures that the results are within a specified range, which is crucial for cryptographic operations.*/
