 Here's a complete lesson on the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find Bézout's coefficients and the
  multiplicative modular inverse, along with step-by-step explanations and examples.

Lesson: The Extended Euclidean Algorithm
1. Introduction
The Extended Euclidean Algorithm is an extension of the standard Euclidean Algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 
two numbers. In addition to finding the GCD, it also computes Bézout's coefficients, which are integers "x" and "y" that satisfy
 Bézout's identity: ax + by = gcd(a, b).

This algorithm is essential in number theory, modular arithmetic, cryptography, and solving linear Diophantine equations.

2. Basic Understanding
To get started, let's establish some foundational concepts:

Bézout's Identity: Bézout's identity states that for any two integers "a" and "b," there exist integers "x" and "y" such that 
ax + by = gcd(a, b). The Extended Euclidean Algorithm helps find these coefficients.

Greatest Common Divisor (GCD): The GCD of two integers "a" and "b" is the largest positive integer that divides both "a" and "b" 
without leaving a remainder. It plays a significant role in number theory and has numerous applications.

Modular Inverse: The Extended Euclidean Algorithm can also be used to find the modular multiplicative inverse of an integer "a"
 modulo "m." This is an integer "x" such that ax ≡ 1 (mod m).

3. Step-by-Step Algorithm
Let's walk through the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:

Step 1: Start with two integers "a" and "b," where "a" is larger than "b."

Step 2: Use the standard Euclidean Algorithm to find the GCD of "a" and "b."

Step 3: Perform the standard Euclidean Algorithm until the remainder becomes zero.

Step 4: Work backward to find "x" and "y."

Step 5: The last non-zero remainder is the GCD, and the coefficients "x" and "y" are the Bézout's coefficients.

4. Using the Algorithm
Example 1: Find the GCD of 48 and 18 using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.

Use the standard Euclidean Algorithm to find the GCD:
GCD(48, 18) = 6

Work backward:

Write the division steps:
48 = 18 * 2 + 12
18 = 12 * 1 + 6
12 = 6 * 2 + 0
Work backward to find "x" and "y" by starting with 0 and 1:
For GCD(48, 18), x = 0, y = 1
For GCD(18, 12), x = 1, y = -2
For GCD(12, 6), x = -2, y = 5
For GCD(6, 0), x = 5, y = -14
The coefficients "x" and "y" for GCD(48, 18) are 5 and -14, respectively.

Example 2: Find the modular multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 11 using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.

Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the GCD and coefficients:

GCD(3, 11) = 1
Coefficients: x = 4, y = -1
Adjust the coefficients for a positive value within the modulo:

In this case, x = 4.
The modular multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 11 is 4, as 3 * 4 ≡ 1 (mod 11).

5. Time Complexity
The time complexity of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm is O(log(min(a, b))), just like the standard Euclidean Algorithm.
 It efficiently finds the GCD and coefficients for relatively large integers.

6. Applications
The Extended Euclidean Algorithm is widely used in cryptography, modular arithmetic, solving linear Diophantine equations, 
and calculating modular inverses, making it a crucial tool in computer science and number theory.

7. Conclusion
The Extended Euclidean Algorithm is a powerful tool for finding Bézout's coefficients, the modular multiplicative inverse,
 and solving linear Diophantine equations. It plays a significant role in various mathematical 
and computational applications, making it a fundamental concept to understand in mathematics and computer science.
