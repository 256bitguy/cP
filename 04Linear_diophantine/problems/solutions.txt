Basic Level:

To determine if a Linear Diophantine Equation ax + by = c has integer solutions, use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the GCD of 'a' and 'b.' If the GCD divides 'c,' there are integer solutions.

To find one particular solution (x, y) to the equation ax + by = c, apply the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find BÃ©zout's coefficients. Use these coefficients to compute one solution.

Intermediate Level:

To find all integer solutions to the equation ax + by = c, first ensure that the GCD of 'a' and 'b' divides 'c.' Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find a particular solution (x, y). Then, express the general solution in terms of parameters.

To find the general solution (x, y) in terms of parameters for the equation ax + by = c, follow the steps of finding a particular solution and express the general solution as 'x = x_particular + (b / GCD) * n' and 'y = y_particular - (a / GCD) * n,' where 'n' is an integer.

To solve the equation 15x + 10y = 5 for integer values of x and y, follow the general steps of solving Diophantine Equations, such as finding the GCD and expressing the general solution.

Advanced Level:

To find the positive integer solutions (x, y) of the equation 21x + 14y = 7, you can apply the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find a particular solution and express the general solution. Ensure the solutions are positive integers.

To find the total number of solutions for the equation ax + by = c, use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find a particular solution. Then, express the general solution and count the number of valid solutions.

To minimize the absolute values of x and y in the equation 18x + 12y = 6, you can apply the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find a particular solution. Then, modify the general solution to minimize the values.

To handle multiple Linear Diophantine Equations with a single function, create a function that takes input equations as an array or data structure. Use a loop or recursion to solve each equation and return the results.

To find the general solution for the equation ax + by = c with specific constraints like x > 0 and y > 0, first find the general solution. Then, impose the constraints and adjust the solution accordingly to satisfy the constraints.

These steps should guide you in solving the provided Linear Diophantine Equation problems at different difficulty levels. The key is to understand the fundamental techniques for solving such equations and apply them as needed.
