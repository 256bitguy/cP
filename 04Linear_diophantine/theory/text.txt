Lesson: Linear Diophantine Equations
1. Introduction
A Linear Diophantine Equation is an equation of the form:

ax + by = c

Where 'a,' 'b,' 'c,' 'x,' and 'y' are integers, and we aim to find integer solutions 'x' and 'y' that satisfy the equation. These equations are named after the ancient Greek mathematician Diophantus, who extensively studied them.

Linear Diophantine equations have applications in various fields, including number theory, cryptography, optimization, and computer science.

2. Understanding
To solve a Linear Diophantine Equation, several key concepts should be understood:

Integer Solutions: The goal is to find integer solutions 'x' and 'y' that satisfy the equation.

GCD (Greatest Common Divisor): The GCD of 'a' and 'b' plays a crucial role in determining whether a solution exists. If 'c' is not divisible by the GCD of 'a' and 'b,' there are no integer solutions.

Bézout's Identity: If the GCD of 'a' and 'b' divides 'c,' then Bézout's identity states that there exist integers 'x' and 'y' that satisfy the equation.

3. Solving Techniques
Step 1: Calculate the GCD of 'a' and 'b' using the Euclidean Algorithm. If the GCD doesn't divide 'c,' there are no integer solutions.

Step 2: If the GCD divides 'c,' apply the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find Bézout's coefficients 'x' and 'y.' These coefficients will provide one particular solution.

Step 3: Use the particular solution to find the general solution. You can do this by adding or subtracting integer multiples of 'b/GCD' to 'x' and 'a/GCD' to 'y.'

Step 4: Express the general solution as:
x = x_particular + (b/GCD) * n
y = y_particular - (a/GCD) * n

Where 'n' is an integer representing all possible solutions.

4. Examples
Example 1: Solve the Linear Diophantine Equation 21x + 14y = 7.

Step 1: Calculate GCD(21, 14) = 7. As 7 divides 7 (c), solutions exist.

Step 2: Apply the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find Bézout's coefficients:

x = 0
y = 1
Step 3: The particular solution is x = 0, y = 1.

Step 4: Express the general solution:
x = 0 + (14/7) * n = 2n
y = 1 - (21/7) * n = 1 - 3n

Example 2: Solve the Linear Diophantine Equation 12x + 9y = 15.

Step 1: Calculate GCD(12, 9) = 3. As 3 divides 15 (c), solutions exist.

Step 2: Apply the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find Bézout's coefficients:

x = -1
y = 4
Step 3: The particular solution is x = -1, y = 4.

Step 4: Express the general solution:
x = -1 + (9/3) * n = -1 + 3n
y = 4 - (12/3) * n = 4 - 4n

5. Applications
Linear Diophantine equations find applications in various fields, including:

Cryptography (e.g., RSA algorithm)
Resource allocation and optimization problems
Linear programming
Number theory and modular arithmetic
Computer algorithms and computational mathematics
