Here are steps to solve each of the ten Euler's Totient Function problems, categorized by level:

Basic Level:

Calculate φ(n):

Write a C++ function that takes a positive integer 'n' as input.
Implement the Euler's Totient Function algorithm to calculate φ(n).
Return the result.

Use the φ function to calculate φ(12) in C++.
Output the result.
Calculate φ(n) for a Range:

Write a loop that iterates through values of 'n' from 1 to 10.
For each 'n', use the Euler's Totient Function to calculate φ(n) and display the results.

Calculate φ(mn) for Coprime 'm' and 'n':

Write a function that takes 'm' and 'n' as input.
Check if 'm' and 'n' are coprime.
If coprime, calculate φ(mn) = φ(m) * φ(n).

Write a program to find two distinct prime numbers, 'p' and 'q'.
Calculate φ(n) where 'n' is the product of 'p' and 'q' using the formula φ(n) = (p - 1)(q - 1).
Advanced Level:

Sum of φ(n) for Perfect Square φ(n):

Write a loop to increment 'n' from 1 and calculate φ(n) for each 'n'.
Check if φ(n) is a perfect square.
If it is, add 'n' to the sum.
Smallest 'n' for Divisible φ(n):
