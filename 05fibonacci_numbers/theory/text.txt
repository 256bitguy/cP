 Here's a complete lesson on Fibonacci numbers, covering their definition, properties, applications, and coding examples:

Lesson: Fibonacci Numbers
1. Introduction
Fibonacci numbers, named after the Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa (known as Fibonacci), are a sequence of numbers 
where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence typically starts with 0 and 1. Mathematically, the 
Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:

F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n â‰¥ 2

The Fibonacci sequence begins as follows: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on.

2. Properties
Recursive Definition: Each number in the sequence is the sum of the two preceding numbers.
Closed-Form Expression: The nth Fibonacci number can be expressed using a closed-form formula known as Binet's formula.
Golden Ratio: The ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers approaches the golden ratio (approximately 1.61803398875).
Divisibility: Some interesting divisibility properties are associated with Fibonacci numbers.
3. Applications
Fibonacci numbers have numerous applications in various fields:

Mathematics: Fibonacci numbers are a classic example in number theory and combinatorics.
Fibonacci numbers are a fascinating mathematical concept with a wide range of applications. Whether you're interested in the pure 
mathematics behind them or their practical use in computer science and design, Fibonacci numbers offer an engaging and diverse area 
of study. Understanding and working with Fibonacci numbers can provide insights into the natural world and help solve various 
mathematical and real-world problems.
