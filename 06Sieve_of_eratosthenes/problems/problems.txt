Write a program to determine if a given number 'n' is a prime number using trial division.
Calculate the sum of all prime numbers up to 100 using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
Intermediate Level:

Develop a C++ program to find all prime numbers in a specified range [m, n] using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
Implement a function in C++ to count the total number of prime numbers up to a given limit using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
Write a program to find the largest prime number less than 1,000 using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
Create a C++ program that lists all twin prime pairs (consecutive prime numbers with a difference of 2) up to 500.
Implement a program to find the smallest prime number with 'k' digits using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
Advanced Level:
