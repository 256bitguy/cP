Here are the steps to solve each of the ten questions related to the Sieve of Eratosthenes:

Basic Level:

Find Primes Up to 50:

Initialize a boolean array to represent prime numbers up to 50.
Start with the first prime, 2.
Iterate through the array and mark multiples of each prime number as non-prime.
Print the numbers that are still marked as prime.
Check Prime Using Sieve:

Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate prime numbers up to a limit that includes 'n.'
Check if 'n' is present in the list of prime numbers.
Find the 10th Prime Number:

Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate prime numbers.
Keep counting the generated prime numbers until you reach the 10th prime.
Trial Division for Primality Testing:

Write a function that checks if 'n' is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of 'n'.
If 'n' is divisible by any number, it's not prime; otherwise, it's prime.
Sum of Primes Up to 100:

Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find prime numbers up to 100.
Sum all the prime numbers in the list.
Intermediate Level:

Find Primes in a Range [m, n]:

Modify the Sieve of Eratosthenes to work within a specified range [m, n].
Use the modified sieve to find prime numbers within the range.
Count Primes Up to a Limit:

Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find prime numbers up to a given limit.
Count the number of primes in the list.
Find Largest Prime Under 1,000:

Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find prime numbers up to 1,000.
Print the largest prime number from the list.
List Twin Prime Pairs:

Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find prime numbers up to 500.
Check for twin prime pairs (consecutive prime numbers with a difference of 2) in the list.
Smallest Prime with 'k' Digits:

Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find prime numbers.
Continue generating prime numbers until you find one with 'k' digits.
Advanced Level:

Primes in Fibonacci Sequence:

Generate the Fibonacci sequence using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
Identify prime numbers within the sequence up to the specified limit.
Sieve with Segmented Sieving:

Implement segmented sieving using the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find prime numbers in the range [m, n].
Generate First 'n' Primes:

Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate a large list of prime numbers.
Print the first 'n' primes from the list.
Prime Factorization with Sieve:

Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate prime numbers.
Implement prime factorization to find the prime factors of a given number.
Optimized Sieve:

Implement an optimized Sieve of Eratosthenes, such as the "wheel factorization" technique, to find prime numbers more efficiently.
These steps should guide you through solving each of the questions related to the Sieve of Eratosthenes, from basic operations to more advanced techniques and optimizations.
