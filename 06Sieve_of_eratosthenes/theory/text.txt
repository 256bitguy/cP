Lesson: Sieve of Eratosthenes
1. Introduction
The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient and efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a specified limit. 
It was developed by the Greek mathematician Eratosthenes around 240 BCE. The algorithm is a fundamental tool in number theory 
and is used for various applications, including cryptography and prime number generation.

2. Algorithm
The Sieve of Eratosthenes works as follows:

Start with a list of integers from 2 to the specified limit.
Begin with the first unmarked number (2).
Mark all multiples of that number (2) as composite.
Move to the next unmarked number (3), which is the next prime.
Mark all multiples of 3 as composite.
Continue this process for each unmarked number, marking its multiples.
The unmarked numbers that remain are prime numbers.
3. Implementation
Here's a step-by-step implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes in C++:

cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void sieveOfEratosthenes(int limit) {
    std::vector<bool> isPrime(limit + 1, true);

    for (int p = 2; p * p <= limit; p++) {
        if (isPrime[p]) {
            for (int i = p * p; i <= limit; i += p) {
                isPrime[i] = false;
            }
        }
    }

    // Print the prime numbers
    for (int p = 2; p <= limit; p++) {
        if (isPrime[p]) {
            std::cout << p << " ";
        }
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    int limit = 30; // Specify the limit to find primes up to 30
    sieveOfEratosthenes(limit);
    return 0;
}
4. Complexity
The Sieve of Eratosthenes has a time complexity of approximately O(n*log(log(n))), where 'n' is the specified limit.
The space complexity is O(n) due to the boolean array used to mark numbers.
5. Examples
Example 1: Finding Primes Up to 30

When you run the code above with a limit of 30, it will output the prime numbers up to 30: 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29.

Example 2: Large Primes

The Sieve of Eratosthenes can efficiently find large prime numbers, making it a crucial tool in prime number generation and cryptography.

6. Conclusion
The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a classic and efficient algorithm for finding prime numbers. Its simplicity and effectiveness have made it a valuable tool for various mathematical and computational applications. Understanding how to implement and use the algorithm is important for working with prime numbers and solving related problems.
