// 5.Explain the step-by-step process of the Euclidean Algorithm for finding the GCD of two numbers.
/* 
1.first step is to define a function with two parameter
2. run while loop until the second number gets zero
3.in while loop create a temp variable of type int and then swap the value of first with temp and second with temp
