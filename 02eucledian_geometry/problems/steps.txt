Basic Questions:

Find the GCD of 24 and 18 using the Euclidean Algorithm:

Start with the larger number (24) and the smaller number (18).
Divide 24 by 18 to get a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 6.
Replace 24 with 18 and 18 with 6, and repeat the division.
Continue until the remainder becomes 0. The GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 6.
Determine the GCD of 35 and 70 using the Euclidean Algorithm:

Start with the larger number (70) and the smaller number (35).
Divide 70 by 35 to get a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 0.
The GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 35.
Calculate the GCD of 14 and 28 using the recursive version of the Euclidean Algorithm:

Use the recursive function, which repeatedly replaces the larger number with the remainder until the remainder becomes 0.
gcd(14, 28) = gcd(28, 14) = gcd(14, 14) = 14.
What is the GCD of 0 and 15? Does the Euclidean Algorithm work for this case?

The GCD of 0 and any positive number b is b. The Euclidean Algorithm works for this case and returns b as the GCD.
Explain the step-by-step process of the Euclidean Algorithm for finding the GCD of two numbers:

Start with two positive integers, a and b.
Divide the larger number by the smaller number, obtaining a quotient and a remainder.
Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder.
Repeat the process until the remainder becomes 0. The GCD is the last non-zero remainder.
